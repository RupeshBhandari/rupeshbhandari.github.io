If you have installed the Linux distro on your PC but you realize that it doesn’t recognize Nepali fonts. Googling it, reading thousands of comments, yet it’s hard to find a proper way! Quite frustrating right!! Don’t worry i done all that and found a solution. You can thank me later! But for now discuss how it can be done:

## Method 1

For instance, you can set Nepali layout from the Setting>Input method and Select the Nepali layout.

However, this layout will be difficult to use so that you follow another method.

## Method 2

1. Open the Terminal
1. Install ibus-m17n package from the terminal
1. sudo apt install ibus-m17n
1. Restart the PC
1. Check on the task bar EN will be appear
1. Right click on it and go to the preference
1. Go to the input method
1. Add Nepali
1. Select traditional Nepali

Thanks for your time. Stay tuned for more updates! :)
