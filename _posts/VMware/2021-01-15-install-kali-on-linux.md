In this post, I will show you how to install the latest version of Kali Linux (2021.1)[^1] on VMware Workstation 16 Pro [^2]. This will allow you to have a Kali virtual machine as a guest operating system on your host machine. This way of using Kali is very effective and used by a lot of people.

Kali was built and is maintained by (<a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/" target="_blank">Offensive Security</a>), it has hundreds of tools available for security auditing, penetration testing and ethical hacking. Below are the steps for installing Kali Linux: ‚Äì

1. Download the iso file for Kali Linux

    Go to the <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Official Kali Linux website</a> and browse to the downloads section. From the download page, download the 64-bit or 32-bit installer based upon your system configuration.

    ![Step 1](/assets/img/kalionvm/1.jpg)

2. Open VMware Workstation and click on ‚ÄúCreate a New Virtual Machine‚Äù

    In VMware, click on File -> New Virtual Machine or click on Create a New Virtual Machine from Home. This will open the ‚ÄúNew Virtual Machine Wizard‚Äù.

    ![Step 2](/assets/img/kalionvm/2.png)

3. ‚ÄúNew Virtual Machine Wizard‚Äù dialogue box opens

    The configuration wizard will have two options. ‚ÄúTypical‚Äù is for creating a virtual machine with default settings. ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù is for advanced options like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI" target="_blank">SCSI Controller</a> type, virtual disk type, etc. We will choose the default i.e. ‚ÄúTypical‚Äù configuration.

    ![Step 3](/assets/img/kalionvm/3.jpg)

4. Select the installation source

    Browse to the downloaded iso file on your system and click Next. VMware usually detects the operating system in the disc image (iso file), but not with Kali Linux. So, ignore the warning and proceed further.

    ![Step 4](/assets/img/kalionvm/4.jpg)

5. Select the guest operating system

    Select Linux as the guest operating system. Choose <a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">Debian</a> 9.x 64-bit or 32-bit based on your system configuration and click Next.

    ![Step 5](/assets/img/kalionvm/5.jpg)

6. Virtual machine name and location

    Enter a name for your virtual machine. You can choose the default location which will be Documents\Virtual Machines or you can choose any other location.

    ![Step 6](/assets/img/kalionvm/6.jpg)

7. Specify Disk Capacity

    The maximum disk size is the maximum space that your virtual machine can utilize after it is created. You can choose the recommended size of 20 GB if your requirements are not much. Otherwise, you can increase the size if you plan on installing heavy software on your virtual machine. This has to be done based upon your system‚Äôs configuration.

    You can store the virtual disk as a single file on your computer or split it into multiple files. The flexibility to move your virtual machine from one computer to another will be better with the second option. The performance will be reduced though will larger disk files.

    ![Step 7](/assets/img/kalionvm/7.jpg)

8. Ready to Create Virtual Machine

    The dialogue box will show the virtual machine settings that you chose in the previous steps. You can proceed with these settings and click Finish, or you can choose to Customize Hardware.

    ![Step 8.1](/assets/img/kalionvm/8.1.jpg)

    You can increase the RAM allocated to the virtual machine using the slider. Choose a higher value only if your host machine has enough RAM. You can also increase the number of processors and the number of cores per processor. Again, this depends on whether your host machine has enough processing power.

    After you are done, click on Close and then click on Finish.

    ![Step 8.2](/assets/img/kalionvm/8.2.jpg)

9. Power on the virtual machine

    Click on ‚ÄúPower on this virtual machine‚Äù to start the newly created virtual machine.
