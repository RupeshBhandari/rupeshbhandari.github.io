Mr. Ivàn Duque
President of the Republic of Colombia
Palacio de Nariño
Carrera 8 No. 7-26
Bogotà, Columbia

Dear Mr President,

Jani Silva has been standing alongside the campesino farmers in the Putumayo region since her childhood. She has dedicated her life to defending the environment and natural resources.

However, Jani’s work has put her in dangerous circumstances. She has been intimidated by unknown aggressors with guns and threatened with death.

As protectors of resources that the world depends on amazon for its survival. The resources in that area had been contracted to big oil firms, which has already produced a negative externality (poisoned water sources), such actions of big corporations could derail climate change action being taken by the country.

Hence, I call on you to protect Jani and all members of ADISPA, an organization she founded along with her colleagues to preserve the peasant Amazon Pearl Reserve Zone. In doing so, you will be safeguarding no just them, but a whole ecosystem powering the planet.

Yours sincerely,
Rupesh Bhandari
Gokarneshwor 3, Kathmandu,
